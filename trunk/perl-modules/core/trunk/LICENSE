OpenXPKI is available under two licenses. This project based on
work done for OpenCA originally. Due to some conflicts some authors
of this code agreed to start a new project with their code. OpenCA
had a tradition of using the most open license type which requires
a non-copyleft license.

Otherwise the most Perl modules are covered by the GPL. The FSF thinks 
that the licenses of the Aapche Software Foundation are incompatibel
with their GPL. Therefore we distribute all modules under the GPL
too to avoid any trouble for GPLed projects.

1.) Apache Software License 2.0 or later
2.) GPL 2 or later

Please note that the copyright holders are still the contributors.
You can find any contributor in the file credits.
We choose a way like Linux to ensure the future of this project.
