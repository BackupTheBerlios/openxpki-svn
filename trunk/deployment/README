Base configuration
==================
(install paths, database etc.)

> ./configure

This will ask the user for the install path, daemon user and
database settings. It creates an adapted configuration file
openxpki.conf and the installation Makefile in the current
directory. Implemented.

Installation
============

> make install

This installs the required shell scripts (daemon start script
and config helper), the initial openxpki.conf and the XML
configuration templates to the configured directories.
Implemented.

Configuration
=============

> cd ...etc/openxpki
> ./openxpki-configure

This step will ask the user for PKI details, such as the number
and names of the PKI realms to configure, CA setup, profile etc.
It writes the configuration changes to
...etc/openxpki/openxpki.conf and creates the XML configuration
files from the settings that were entered.

From this on the user can decide how to go from there:

1) Inexperienced users or those who are willing to use a
   simplified configuration can continue to use the meta-
   configuration in openxpki.conf, apply changes there and
   generates the XML files from the templates. The XML
   configuration files will be overwritten by this procedure.

   In this case the user will usually:

   > cd .../etc/openxpki
   > ./openxpki-configure
   > openxpkictl reload

2) "Power users" will probably choose not to use the meta-
   configuration and modify the XML files directly:

   > cd .../etc/openxpki
   > rm -f openxpki.conf openxpki-configure
   > vi config.xml token.xml ...
   > openxpkictl reload
