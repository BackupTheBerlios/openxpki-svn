<h2>Layer Design</h2>

<p>
  OpenXPKI tries to implement a MVC design (Model-View-Controller).
  The parts are defined as follows:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Model</dt>
  <dd>
    The model is implemented by a workflow engine. This
    includes things like the configuration or the state
    handling.
  </dd>
  <dt>Controller</dt>
  <dd>
    The controllers are represented by the different workflow
    activities. Every activity can manipulate the state
    of a workflow including its properties.
  </dd>
  <dt>View</dt>
  <dd>
    The view is represented by the user interfaces. I have to
    admit though that the term is not fully correct. The
    user interface consists of several layers to get better code:
    <ul>
      <li>the service layer</li>
      <li>the messaging or serialization layer</li>
      <li>the transport layer</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  The major idea is to make the user interfaces much
  more flexible. It should be possible to use different
  transport protocol and it must alos be possible to
  user other frontend language than Perl (e.g. PHP).
  The different layers are defined as follows:
  <ol>
    <li>The service layer
      <p>
        The messaging layer parses queries, executes necessary
        commands and build resulting answers.
        The format of the queries and answers are defined by
        the interface itself but in the native language (Perl).
        This means that a message can look like this:
<pre>
  my %msg = (COMMAND => "search_csr",
             PARAMS  => {CN => "*Doe*"},
             LIMIT   => 20);
</pre>
        The service layer defines a communication protocol but
        only on the level of native Perl messages. This means
        that a client send the above message but the answer is:
<pre>
  my %msg = (ANSWER_TYPE => "COMMAND",
             COMMAND     => "GET_PKI_REALM",
             PKI_REALMS  => {"root_ca" => "Our super root CA",
                             "user_ca" => "User CA"});
</pre>
        If this happens then the client must answer with root_ca
        or user_ca. Usually the next answer is the request for
        a login stack followed by the real login. Additionally
        the first answer can include a session ID. Like you see
        it is possible to implement a real communication protocol
        here. The only important thing is that we do not define
        any aspect of the serialization (the message representation)
        and the transport here.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>The messaging or serialization layer
      <p>
        The service layer only defines how messages should look
        like in the used native language (Perl). This means a
        message is usually a hash. The serialization layer must
        produce now a plain text representation of this data.
        This can be a XML file or every other specially formatted
        text file. Please note that file does not mean that we
        write it on the disk. It is only a string in the memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This layer only has to serialize datastructures and
        to deserialize strings. It is not the job of this layer
        to distinguish between different message types. This
        is the job of the service layer which defines the
        real protocol. It is possible of course that some
        messages are serialized another way because they carry
        a special flag but this makes no difference for the
        interface usage and behaviour of this layer.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>The transport layer
      <p>
        The job of the transport layer is simple. It gets a plain
        text string and must bring this string to the other peer.
        The transport layer must not contain any knowledge about
        the communication protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        The minimum interface looks like this until now:
        <ul>
          <li>new (incl. open)</li>
          <li>close</li>
          <li>write</li>
          <li>read</li>
        </ul>
        The problem is that this interface is fully synchronous.
        Actually I see no problem here but perhaps we must extend
        this interface in the future to support asynchronous
        mechanisms too. Nevertheless PKI is today mainly
        a synchronous business.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>Reference Implementation</h2>

<h3>Service Protocol</h3>

<p>
  The first step is that we define a normal protocol
  workflow. If it is possible then we should express
  the whole protocol as one formula.
  <pre>
    session ::= (init_session|continue_session).
                use_session*.
                (stop_session|nothing)

    init_session ::= create_session_id.
                     select_pki_realm.
                     select_auth_stack.
                     login

    use_session ::= request_command.
                    (
                     token_login*.
                     send_answer*.
                    )*.
                    (answer_complete|error)

    stop_session ::= delete_session_id
  </pre>
  This is a first abstraction for a session. Please note
  that this works for web clients which cut the connection
  everytime and for shell clients which are connected until
  they logout.
</p>

<h3>Serialization</h3>

<p>
  Until now it looks like we must only serialize data structures like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>hash references
  <li>array references
  <li>scalars
</ul>
<p>
  The problem is that we must implement this as a platform
  and language independent message which is really fast parseable.
  The idea is to allow only the following:
  <pre>
    (hashref.arrayref)* ::= scalar

    $href-&gt;{CERT}-&gt;[1]-&gt;{SUBJECT}-&gt;[0] = "dc=www,dc=openxpki,dc=org";
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
* and + always mean MAX_LENGTH. Perhaps it is necessary for
non-script languages to split the scalar type into integer and
string or something other.
</p>
<pre>
hash         ::= hash_element+
hash_element ::= [1-9][0-9]*.'\n'.    /* length of the hash key */
                 [a-zA-Z0-9_]+.'\n'.  /* the hash key */
                 array

array         ::= array_element+
array_element ::= [0-9]+.'\n'. /* position in the array */
                  ('HASH\n'.hash|'SCALAR\n'.scalar)

scalar ::= [0-9]+.'\n'. /* length of data */
           data
</pre>
<p>
  Finally the serialization must store in every serialized
  message which service was used. This is necessary to be able
  to detect the correct service if the service is reconnected
  from the client and vice versa.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

  <li>Perpared answer</li>
  <li>Serialized answer</li>
  <li>Send answer</li>
  <li>Waiting for next message or terminating</li>
</ul>
<h4>Client View</h4>

  <li>Serialize query
  <li>Write query to transport layer
  <li>Connecting server</li>
  <li>Send transport protocol identifier</li>
  <li>Send serialized message</li>
  <li>Receive answer</li>
  <li>Deserialize answer</li>
  <li>Evaluate answer</li>
  <li>Continue with waiting for the next message (e.g. exports),
    sending a response or next query</li>
</ul>
