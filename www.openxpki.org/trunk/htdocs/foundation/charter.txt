Charter of OpenXPKI

1. Mission

The major goal of the OpenXPKI foundation is to support the
OpenXPKI community to develop free PKI software.

The foundation as the organizational backend of the project has
to support the community with the management of the name, the
license and the infrastructure. This includes the organization
of isupport and promotion events like workshops and conferences.

The people who owns the domain openxpki.org and the basic
infrastructure rights on the development platforms like Berlios
or SourceForge have to guarantee via a written statement to
every board member that they will respect the decisions of the
board. Otherwise they have to give back the rights or ownership.

2. Roles

OpenXPKI knows three kinds of peoples - users, active developers
and board members. Users are all people which use OpenCA. Board
members are members of the board like defined below. Active
developers are people who are actively developing the OpenXPKI
software since the last two years. The term "devloping" includes
explicitely every development task like testing, documenting and
writing code. If you document the software then you are a
developer too. All people who are accepted as active developers
are publicly listed in file. If you think you should be on the
list simply write a notice to the developer mailing list.

3. Board

The board of the project consists of elected members. There are two
sorts of members. One group of members will be built from active
developers and one group from all users. Yes developers are users
two and they can vote twice.

The group which will be elected from the active developers must
have at minimum 2/3 of the elected board members. The background
is that the developers can make all decisions if they agree on an
issue and cannot be blocked by the users in this case.

The group which is elected from all users which include the developers
must not have more than 1/3 of the board members. This group should
represent the interests of the users. If the developers find no
consense then their vote should be a deciding factor.

The maximum number of board members is 12. The normal legislative
period is 2 years.

4. Election

The voting will happen on the OpenXPKI voting mailing list.
Today this is OpenXPKI-vote@lists.berlios.de

4.1. Users

The users can have at maximum four representatives in the board.
This results in the fact that every user has four votes. A user
can only give one vote per candidate. The candidates with the
most votes wins.

4.2. Active Developers

The active developers can have at maximum eight representatives
in the board. This results in the fact that every active
developer has eight votes. An active developer can only give one
vote per candidate. The candidates with the most votes wins.

4.3. Protective clauses

If there are more than two votes from employers or owners of one
organization or company then only two votes are counted. The
management of the organization or company can make the decision
or if this does not happen then the old board decide about the
counting.

If there are lesser than eight active developer representatives
in the board then the number of the user representatives will be
automatically reduced to balance the board again.

If a board member dismisses then a new election only for this
position will be started. The legislative period ends with the
legislative period of the other board members.

If all other board members agree then one other board member can
be dismissed. Again this is only allowed if all other board
members agree on this. If the dismissed board member is elected
again then the next dismissal can only be after six months.

5. Responsibilities

5.1. Community

The community make all decisions related to the charter. The
election of the board is an exclusive previleges of the whole
community too.

If the charter should be changed then there must be a voting on
this. The following points must be meet for a successful voting:

* 50 percent of all active developers must vote for the charter
  change.
* At minimum 2/3 of all voting active developers must vote for
  the charter change.
* At minimum 2/3 of all voting users (including the active
  developers) must vote for the charter change.
* Like for e normal elections only two vote per organization or
  company are allowed.

5.2. Board

The board knows two types of responsibilities - critical issues
and normal issues.

Critical issues are the license and the name of OpenXPKI. Any
decisions relating to these issues must be made by the board
with majority of at minimum 2/3 of all board members.

All other issues are normal issues. The decisions will be made
by the board with a normal majority of all board members.
Normal issues can be administrative rights, workshops and
infrastructure issues for example.

Every vote for a decision of the board must be publicly
documented on the openxpki voting list.
