Todays we still discuss about the licenses. We a need a non-copyleft, GPL
compatible license. Any proposals are welcome. The LGPL is not listed
because it looks like a copyleft license.

1. Dual licensing with GPL v2 or later and Apache software License v2 or later

2. Modified BSD license (http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5)

... perhaps you find another license. If yes then simply make
proposal on the users list.
