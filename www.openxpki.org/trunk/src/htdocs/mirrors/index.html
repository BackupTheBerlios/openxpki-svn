        <h2>OpenXPKI Mirror</h2>
        <p>
          OpenXPKI uses a set of <a href="www.html">www mirrors</a> to 
          distribute the projects website.<br/>
          The current development is done on the berlios svn. Anonymous 
          access to the repository is possible if you want to look at
          the current development code. Currently there are no snapshots
          or tarballs available - we will announce their date and kind of
          distribution as soon as we decide to publish them here on the 
          website an through our Mailinglists (see <a href="../resources">
          resources</a>).
        </p>
        <h2>Mirrors of the OpenCA Project</h2>
        <p>
          The former www mirror of the openca.info website is superseded
          by this website. There is a ftp mirror system for releases of
          OpenCA - you can find a mirror close to you <a href="ftp.html">
          here</a>. 
        </p>
