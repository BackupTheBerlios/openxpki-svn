        <h3>Workshops</h3>
        <p>
          Starting on 12. October 2004 we did a first workshop for interested 
          OpenCA Users - we plan to continue holding such workshops and want to 
          publish the slides and other informations that may be valuable for a 
          bigger audience here.
